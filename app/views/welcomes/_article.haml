          One Window for Citizens (OW4C) is a three-year project (October 2019-September 2022) that uses technology to provide Cambodian citizens clear, transparent information on public services available to them through the government of Cambodiaâ€™s One Window Service Offices (OWSOs). In order to empower citizens and ensure accountability for OWSO services, OW4C technology offers real-time information explaining the application processes for key services as well as the required documents, materials, and service fees. It also provides a safe space for citizens to voice their feedback on the quality of services received.

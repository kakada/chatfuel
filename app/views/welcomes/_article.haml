          USAIDâ€™s One Window for Citizens (OW4C) is a three-year project 
          (October 2019-September 2022) that uses technology to provide 
          Cambodian citizens clear, transparent information on public 
          services available to them through the government One Window 
          Service Offices (OWSOs). In order to empower citizens and 
          ensure accountability for OWSO services, OW4C technology offers 
          real-time information explaining application processes for 
          key services as well as the required documents, materials, 
          and service fees. It also provides a safe space for citizens 
          to voice their feedback on the quality of services received.
